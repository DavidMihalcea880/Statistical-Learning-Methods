# Statistical-Learning-Methods
This project was focused around regression models and classification models. 
The goal of regression was to use the sensor data provided to predict an accurate time-to-failure which would be used to predict how many cycles each engine would have before maintenance was required. 
The goal of classification was to use the sensor data to classify the engine as either requiring maintanance or not. This would be done given the data taken from the sensors, preventing any mistakes by mechanics.

Regressions Part:
i was required of choosing three different methods of regression with good reasoning, then to compare the three methods of regression in terms of root mean squared and r^2. 
The root mean square would tell me on average how many cycles the regression model was from predicting the exact cycle the engine would fail at. 
The r^2 value on the regression graph tells me how well the model fits the data, usually a value below 1 is acceptable. 

Classification Part:
i was required to select three methods of classification to determine if the engine had reached its time-to-failure in the cycle it was in.
These three methods were compared using the accuracy of the model primarily. 

In the documents profided, all three methods of regression and classification are left in the same file, so it is easier to view all three at once with visual data.
Some of the visual data is also provided as seperate PNG files if it is easier to see it without the code.
